author: Gersom van Ginkel
description: This sandwich topping is tasty, cheap, and easy. I don't use tofu often because it's hard to marinate and becomes dry when fried. Scrambling to the rescue!

1. Cut `1 pack of tofu (375g)` in 8 cubes.
2. Squeeze each block in your fist so the water drains.
3. Crumble the tofu between your fingers and set aside.
4. Cut `2 cloves of garlic` and `2 onions` into small pieces.
5. Heat some oil and fry the onion and garlic.
6. Add the crumbled tofu and bake for another 5 minutes.
7. Add `1 tbsp tomato paste`, `2 tbsp soy sauce`, `1 tsp curry powder`, `1 tsp turmeric powder`, `1 tsp smoked paprika powder` and an optional `Â½ tsp salt`.
8. Thoroughly mix and heat for another minute.

# Tips

- Optional: add `100g baby spinach` and heat until the spinach has shrunk.
- Serving suggestion: make a base layer with a little bit of hummus, avocado and your favorite spicy sauce. Top off with some ketchup.
