# Tips

- It's hard to blend cashew nuts into a sauce using a big food processor. One way to solve this is by soaking the cashews nuts a few hours in advance in hot water. My go-to method is grinding the cashew nuts (without water) in a small food processor bullet and then mixing them in with the rest of the bumbu.
- I often use [this bouillon](https://www.ah.nl/producten/product/wi47146/maggi-drinkbouillon-tuinkruiden-vegetarisch) in recipes. Be careful not to overdo it, since it's full of salt and MSG (E621), but I like it in just the right amount.
- This recipe is based on [another recipe](https://www.ah.nl/allerhande/recept/R-R1189429/vegan-rendang-met-spitskool-en-paddenstoelen). I adjusted it in order to shorten the time needed to cook.
