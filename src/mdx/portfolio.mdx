I’m a freelance **JavaScript** developer with 12+ years of professional experience.

I work both on the **front-end** and **back-end** and although my specialism lies with JavaScript, I have a fair share of knowledge about other things, helping me bridge the gap in a multidisciplinary team.

**Recently, I’ve worked with:**

`JavaScript` `TypeScript` `NodeJS` `Svelte` `SvelteKit` `React` `React Native` `NextJS` `Jest`

**Some of the things I would like to work on:**

`Stateful Web Apps` `Developer Tooling` `DevOps` `Rich Text Editors`
